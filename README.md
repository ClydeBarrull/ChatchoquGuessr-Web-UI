# Message Author Game

A small multiplayer browser game where players guess which author wrote each message.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd message-author-game
npm install            # installs root + server + client deps
npm run dev            # starts socket.io server on :3001 and Vite dev server on :5173
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in as many tabs/computers as you like, enter a name, and start the game.
